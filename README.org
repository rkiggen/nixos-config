The goal of my current NixOS configuration is to create a multi machine / multi user setup where a single user X can
have different profiles across multiple machines.

If you want to learn more about NixOS and the way you can install & configure it, I can recommend the following resources:

* NixOS Installation Guide

Basically the steps are the following:
1. download one of the [[https://nixos.org/download.html][NixOS iso images]] from the NixOS website;
2. burn the iso to a bootable USB flash drive (or copy it to a flash drive prepared with [[https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html][Ventoy]]);
3. boot the installation media;
4. partition the drives from your computer (make sure to verify whether your computer supports UEFI boot or only legacy BIOS boot, and don't forget to label the partitions);
5. generate the NixOS config;
6. install NixOS;

** Preparation

Prepare a usb flash drive with Ventoy and copy the NixOS iso image onto it, now you can boot up the NixOS installer.

** Partitioning

First identify whether your computer uses UEFI or legacy BIOS for booting and then choose the appropriate partioning scheme.

*** Encryption

If you want to encrypt multiple partitions, it is good to know that upon booting the decryption password for the first partition will also be used for decrypting all subsequent partitions.
Which means that if you want to enter only one password for decryption you'll need to encrypt all partitions with the same password.

You can either choose to encrypt the partitions (or drives) first and them use those as physical volumes for LVM (LUKS + LVM or LVM on top of LUKS) or you can set up LVM first and encrypt the logical volums with LUKS later (LVM + LUKS or LUKS on top of LVM). I prefer to use LUKS + LVM.

Create at least 2 partitions one boot partition and one root partition, the boot partition will either be an ext4 partition (legacy BIOS) or a ESP/fat partition (UEFI) whereas the root partition will be a LVM (8300 Linux LVM) partition.
When the partitioning is done, you can setup the encrytion:

#+begin_src
  cryptset luksFormat /dev/sda2 # encrypt the partition with luks
  cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda2 sda2-enc # decrypt the partition to a device name sda2-enc
#+end_src

Now we are ready to add our encrypted volume to LVM:

#+begin_src
 pvcreate /dev/mapper/sda2-enc # add our encrypted partition as physical volume to LVM
 vgcreate vg-nixos /dev/mapper/sda2-enc # add the physical volume to volumegroup vg-nixos
 lvcreate -L 8G -n lv-swap vg-nixos # setup a logical volume (8GB size) for swap purposes in vg-nixos
 lvcreate -l '100%FREE' -n lv-root vg-nixos # create a logical volume for your root (remaing size) in vg-nixos
#+end_src

Format the =swap= and =root= partitions:

#+begin_srcA
 mkswap -L swap /dev/vg-nixos/lv-swap
 mkfs.ext4 -L root /dev/vg-nixos/lv-root 
#+end_src
